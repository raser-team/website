In the field of high-energy particle detection, detectors operating in high-radiation environments primarily face complexity associated with power consumption and cooling systems. Therefore, the development of particle detectors capable of stable operation at room temperature or even elevated temperatures is of great significance. Silicon carbide (SiC) exhibits significant potential for particle detector applications due to its exceptional carrier mobility, radiation hardness, and thermal stability. Over the past decade, significant breakthroughs in silicon carbide epitaxial growth technology and device processing techniques have enabled the development of SiC-based particle detectors, providing a new technological pathway for particle detection in high-temperature environments.

In this work, we fabricate a 4H-SiC PIN detector, named SIlicon CARbide (SICAR) and characterize its leakage current, capacitance, and charge collection across varying temperatures. The results indicate that the detector maintains a very low leakage current (< 10 nA) at 90 °C, with no degradation in depletion capacitance or charge collection performance. Additionally, it achieves a fast rise time of 333 ps at 90 °C, confirming its potential for high-temperature radiation detection applications.

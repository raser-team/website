**Purpose** A high-precision beam monitor system based on silicon carbide PIN sensor is designed for the 1.6 GeV proton beam of China Spallation Neutron Source. The conceptual design of the beam monitor system is composed of front-end electronics with SiC PIN sensor and readout system. 

**Method** The charge collection efficiency of the SiC PIN sensor after proton radiation is studied with 80 MeV proton beam. 98% charge will be collected by the SiC PIN sensor after the system running one year, which can meet requirements of beam monitoring. Research on the performance of the front-end electronics and readout system is completed for better data acquisition. The front-end electronics is studied to figure out the effect of feedback resistor. The readout system can deal with signal with sampling rate of 5 GHz, and the data acquisition rate is 1 Hz.

**Results** The uncertainty of proton beam fluence is below 0.68% in the beam monitor system.

**Conclusion**  The results reveal that the beam monitor system can be used for the 1.6 GeV proton beam of China Spallation Neutron Source.
